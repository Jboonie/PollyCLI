# PollyCLI
## An Easy to Use GUI for Amazon Polly.

This application is designed to allow users to quickly convert a directory of text files into audio files using the AWS Polly command line API.  In order to utilize this application you will need the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/getting-started-cli.html "AWS CLI"), Python, Java, and properly sized text files. You can read more about 
[Polly's limitations here.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/limits.html)

The application is in its early stages and is not considered stable by any means, there is currently little to no error checking though I have done many conversion operations using the application.

Why would you want to use this?  Well, I have used this application quite extensively to convert multiple large scale (2 - 3 million) character web novels into Polly chunks so that I can enjoy audio books on the go.  I will be releasing some of the other tools I use to gather and prepare web text for conversion over time once this application is more stable.
