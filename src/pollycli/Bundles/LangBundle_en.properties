awsHelpInstallingAWSCLI=To install the Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), you will need a few things: Python 2.6.5+ or 3.3+, this app has been developed using version 3 of python though either 2 or 3 should work.  Install AWS CLI via python by using "pip install awscli --upgrade --user" to uninstall you can use "pip uninstall awscli".  For futher details you can find a great deal of reference material on Amazon's website at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/setup-aws-cli.html.
awsHelpConfiguringAWSCLI=To configure AWS CLI to work with your AWS account we need use the "aws configure" command.  Once we have used this command, AWS will ask us to provide: an AWS Access Key ID, an AWS Secret Access Key, a default region name, and a default output format.  You use your AWS console on the AWS website to generate your access key and your secret access key. The URL for the IAM console in AWS is https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#home. Once you have the access keys squared away, simply use a region for example "us-east-1" and the output format "text".  If you have any difficulty or need any further details, please consult https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html.
awsHelpFindingAWSCLI=We need to locate the install location of the AWS CLI executable (aws.cmd).  To find this you need to locate the location of your Python script folder.  Try using %APPDATA% on your start menu to find your AppData\Roaming\ folder.  From there, navigate to the python folder and into the script folder to locate the AWS.CMD file. An example would be: "C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python36\Scripts\aws.cmd".  Lets take this information now and configure PollyCLI.
awsHelpConfiguringPollyCLI=We are almost done! All we need to do is navigate to settings window of PollyCLI, select the AWS section, browse for the location of the aws.cmd file we found previously and then save our settings.  Please note you will also need to populate the other settings too, like Narrator and Output type.

#AboutPage
aboutPageText=Thanks for taking some time to check out this application! When configured, this program will allow you to convert text files in a directory into audio files via Amazon's Polly interface. The goal of this application is to make large scale conversions easy and user friendly so that you don't have to install a whole bunch of confusing stuff.  You will still need to install and configure python and the AWS CLI but I have provided some documentation on the settings page that will hopefully make that as painless as possible!  To follow the development of this project and make sure that you have the most up-to-date version, you can check out the project on github at https://github.com/Jboonie/PollyCLI.  I also want to take a moment and thank http://www.freepik.com & https://www.flaticon.com/ for providing me with the icon used for this project.
